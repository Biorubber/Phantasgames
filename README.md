# Phantasgames
silly little games created using the Ursina Engine and others


I've just finished my first year of University studying Cyber Security and I've gone from knowing nothing about Python to having a fairly confident grasp of the basics. so what better way to hone this knowledge than to make some slop ^_^

Ima be real, this is just for fun and to make sure i dont forget everything before I start again in September

additionally, this is gonna teach me how to use GitHub.
